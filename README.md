# Linear Systems Of Equations

**Version 1.0.0**

Program solving linear systems of equations like A*x=b using 3 methods:
1. Gausse-Seidle
2. Lagrange
3. LU decomposition

Each method was compared to other in terms of time and accuracy. 
Moreover iterative algorithms was compered in term of number of iteration time needed to achieve a given accuracy.

## Technologies used
1. Python 3.9
2. PyCharm 2020
