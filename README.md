# Linear Systems Equations

**Version 1.0.0**

Program solving linear systems of equations like A*x=b using 3 methods:
1. Gausse-Seidle
2. Lagrange
3. LU decomposition

Each method was compared to other in terms of time, accuracy. 
Moreover iterative algorithms was compered in term of number of iteration.

## Technologies used
1. Python 3.9
2. PyCharm 2020
